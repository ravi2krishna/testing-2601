                    -> Ensuring its quality before it's released to end users.

    -> Importance Of Testing

        -> There have been "several instances" where "inadequate software testing" has led to 
        significant consequences 

        -> Therac-25 Radiation Therapy Machine 

            -> In 1980's Therac-25, a radiation therapy machine, was involved in 
            several accidents due to a software bug.

            -> The bug caused the machine to deliver massive overdoses of radiation to patients, 
            leading to injuries and deaths.

            -> Human Life Was a cost 

        -> Mars Climate Orbiter

            -> In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter mission failed due to a software error.

        -> Programming Software means Compilers, Debuggers, Interpreters, 
        IDE's(Integrated Development Environments), these are all Programming Software
        used while developing programs.

        -> Compilers: 
            -> Developers Write Source Code (Human Readable Code)
            -> https://github.com/ravi2krishna/login-2516/blob/main/index.html
            -> Compilers will convert Source Code Into An Intermediate Language called as 
            Byte Code 
        -> Interpreters: 
            -> Build Process Converts Byte Code To Machine Readable Code 
            -> We use Interpreters to Translate and Execute Machine Readable Code

    -> NOTE: The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a "process",
    How to Implement SDLC ? 

    
    -> SDLC Models 

        -> Waterfall Model 

        -> V Model 

        -> Agile Model (Latest & Widely Adopted)


    -> Waterfall Model (1970's)

        -> Software Industry initially began with Waterfall Model

        -> It's also called as Liner or Sequential Model 

        -> It's called Waterfall, because the progress flows Downwards like a waterfall 

            -> https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fairy-falls1500px.jpg

            -> https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEWHYW-hDWlog/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1710138974843?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=lIGnYSv1MUWJRUW38M0qaDnSqu9WWYPENj_OiwO1Shw

    -> Waterfall Advantages 

        -> Simplicity: The straightforward nature of the Waterfall model makes it 
        easy to understand and use.

        -> Structured Approach: Clearly defined stages and milestones provide a 
        structured approach to development.

    -> Waterfall Disadvantages 

        -> Inflexibility: The model is rigid and doesn't accommodate changes well 
        once a phase is completed.

        -> Late Testing:  Testing is done at the end of the development process, 
        which can lead to discovering significant issues late in the project.

        -> No working software is available until the final stages of the lifecycle.


    -> When Should We Prefer Waterfall Model 

        -> Requirements should not be changed 
            -> Requirement always should be freezed 

        -> For Smaller Projects 

        -> Less Budget Projects 


    -> V Model (1990's)

        -> V model is known as Verification and Validation Model 

        -> Extension Of Waterfall Model 

        -> Pairing each development phase with a corresponding, parallel testing phase.

        -> It forms a "V" shape, with the left side focused on verification (static analysis) 
        and the right on validation (dynamic testing), 
        ensuring high quality through early test planning. 

        -> Main Advantage Of V Model is in every phase we have testing 

        -> System Design: Constructing the overall system architecture.
            -> LMS Application Architecture
        
        -> High-Level Design: Defining functional modules and components.
            -> LMS Student Module 
            -> LMS Trainer Module 
            -> LMS Admin Module 
            -> LMS Courses Module 
            -> LMS Exam Module 
        
        -> Low-Level Design: Detailed design for individual components.
            -> LMS Student Module (High-Level)
                -> Student Login 
                -> Student Profile  
                -> Student Courses
                    -> Student Courses List 
                    -> Student Courses Buy 
                -> Student Logout  

        -> https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*1_y1njK_-OW_Sqv1cKlDcg.png


    -> Verification (Left Side - Designing):
        -> Requirements Analysis: Defining customer needs.
        -> System Design: Constructing the overall system architecture.
        -> High-Level Design: Defining functional modules and components.
        -> Low-Level Design: Detailed design for individual components.
        
    -> Coding: The actual development phase.
   
    -> Validation (Right Side - Testing):
        -> Unit Testing: Testing individual components.
        -> Integration Testing: Testing combined components.
        -> System Testing: Testing the entire system.
        -> User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Verifying final requirements with users.

    -> Advantages OF V Model

        -> High Quality: Early test planning catches defects early.
        -> Disciplined: Strict, phased, and well-documented process.
        -> Suitable for Small Projects: Works well where requirements are fixed and clear. 

    -> Disadvantages OF V Model

        -> Rigid: Difficult to handle changes once the project starts.
        -> Late Functionality: Working software is not produced until late in the cycle.
        -> High Risk: Not suitable for complex or long-term projects with changing requirements. 


    -> Agile Model (2001)

        -> The Agile model is an "iterative" and "incremental" software development approach 
        focusing on flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of functional components.

        -> By breaking projects into small, time-boxed iterations (sprints), 
        it enables frequent customer feedback, continuous improvement, and 
        adaptation to changing requirements. 
        
        -> Agile prioritizes working software over comprehensive documentation. 

        -> Agile Characteristics and Principles
        
            -> Iterative & Incremental: Software is developed in small, functional, and incremental releases (usually 2–4 week sprints).
            -> Customer Collaboration: Continuous feedback ensures the product meets evolving needs.
            -> Flexibility: Embraces changing requirements, even late in development.
            -> Self-Organizing Teams: Empowered teams manage their own work, fostering productivity and technical excellence.
            -> Reduced Documentation: Focuses on code over documentation

        -> Advantages: 

            -> High customer satisfaction, fast, high-quality, adaptable, and allows for changes.

        -> Disadvantages: 

            -> Minimal documentation makes maintenance difficult, high dependency on client interaction,

        -> Common Agile Frameworks 
            -> Scrum: Focuses on fixed-length iterations called sprints.(*)
            -> Kanban: Focuses on continuous delivery and workflow visualization.

    -> Popular Project Management Tools 

        -> JIRA (Proprietary)
        -> Azure DevOps (SAAS) (Free with limited capacity)
        -> GitHub Projects (Free)

            -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkqXFi37bRlmIqHM4QCmMinwQ8ug4wKj/view?usp=sharing


    -> QA (Quality Assurance) vs QC (Quality Control)

        -> Quality Assurance

            -> QA refers to the systematic "process" of ensuring that the product meets 
            specified requirements and standards throughout its development lifecycle.

            -> QA activities include process audits, defining quality standards, and 
            implementing best practices to improve overall quality. 

        -> Quality Control

            -> QC involves the "activities" and "techniques" used to monitor and evaluate 
            the quality of the product or service being developed.

            -> QC activities include testing of software components, 
            validation against requirements, reviews of deliverables. 

            -> As a Manual & Automation Tester we are part of Quality Control

    -> NOTE: 

        -> QA focuses on "preventing" defects by improving processes and ensuring 
        that quality is built into the product from the beginning.

        -> QC focuses on "identifying" defects through testing and inspection, 
        aiming to correct them before the product is released.


    -> Start Testing 

        -> Requirement -> Code -> Test 

    -> Unit Testing 

        -> Unit Testing means testing the "smallest testable piece of code" (a unit) 

        -> In technical terms a unit means 

            -> a method or
            -> a function 

        -> Requirement

            -> Developers will not develop the software as a while 

            -> Developers will divide the software into different modules / components,
            which in turn gets divided into multiple tasks i.e methods / functions

            -> As soon as coding is done, Developers perform Unit Testing 

        -> Why Unit Testing 

            -> Find Bugs in Early Stages Of Development 
            -> Document Expected Behavior in Early Stages Of Development 

        -> Unit Testing Techniques 

            -> White Box Testing (Structural Testing) 

                -> We use different techniques like 

                    -> Statement/Path Coverage 
                    -> Branch/Decision Coverage 
                    -> Loop Coverage 

            -> Statement/Path Coverage (Each Line/Statement)

                -> Aimed to ensure that every possible path through the software's source code 
                is executed at least once

                -> The developer will write code, for example he has written some 100 lines of code
                Statement/Path Coverage Test means testing each and line of code at least once 

                    print(Welcome To testing class)
                    print(Unit Testing)
                    print(Unit Testing Techniques)

            -> Branch/Decision/Conditional Coverage (Conditions)

                -> Aims to ensure that every "conditional" statement in the program 
                is executed with all possible outcomes at least once during the test process

                    else:
                    print(You Cannot Vote Underage) 

            -> Loop Coverage (Repeated Actions)

                -> Loop Coverage is dedicated to thoroughly testing the behavior of 
                loop constructs (for, while, do-while) within the application. 
                Loops are used to do repeated actions (Everyday at 12 AM run backup for next month)
                This includes examining loops under various conditions.
