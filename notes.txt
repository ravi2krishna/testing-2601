    -> Manual Testing 

        -> Software Testing 

            -> Application Lifecycle / SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

                -> Requirement Gathering & Analysis 

                -> Design 

                -> Code Implementation

                -> TEST (*)

                -> Deployment  

            -> Software Testing  

                -> Process of evaluating Software Application to ensure Application
                Works Correctly and Meets the Requirement

                -> This Process Involves 

                    -> Various tests to detect any defects or errors

                    -> Ensuring its quality before it's released to end users.

    -> Importance Of Testing

        -> There have been "several instances" where "inadequate software testing" has led to 
        significant consequences 

        -> Therac-25 Radiation Therapy Machine 

            -> In 1980's Therac-25, a radiation therapy machine, was involved in 
            several accidents due to a software bug.

            -> The bug caused the machine to deliver massive overdoses of radiation to patients, 
            leading to injuries and deaths.

            -> Human Life Was a cost 

        -> Mars Climate Orbiter

            -> In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter mission failed due to a software error.

            -> This mistake cost NASA approximately $125 million (1000 Crores )

            -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter

            -> Money Life Was a cost 

    -> NOTE: As you can see, software bugs can create a serious problem, 
    in terms of money, time & lives.

    
    -> Software Testing Concepts 

        -> What is Software 

        -> Types Of Softwares

        -> SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

        -> What Is Quality ? 
        
        -> What are Bugs ? 

        -> What are Errors ? 

        -> What are Test Cases ? 

        -> What are Different Types Of Testing We Conduct ? 

        -> STLC (Software "TESTING" Life Cycle)

    -> Any Company / Organization 

        -> Has Three Primary Components 

            -> People 

            -> Product 

            -> Process 

    
    -> What is Software ? 

        -> Collection Of Computer Programs, which helps users to perform certain tasks

        -> Developers will write Different types of Programs based on Requirements 

        -> Types Of Softwares 

            -> System Softwares  

            -> Programming Softwares 

            -> Application Softwares 

    -> System Softwares 

        -> Softwares which are used to run other types of softwares 

            -> Example: Operating System (Win, Linux, Unix)

            -> Examples: Driver Softwares 

                -> Mouse Driver Software 

                -> Graphics Driver Software (Nvidia)

            -> NOTE: Without Having System Softwares, we cannot use 
            any Programming Softwares & Application Softwares 
        

    -> Programming Softwares

        -> Programming Software means Compilers, Debuggers, Interpreters, 
        IDE's(Integrated Development Environments), these are all Programming Software
        used while developing programs.

        -> Compilers: 
            -> Developers Write Source Code (Human Readable Code)
            -> https://github.com/ravi2krishna/login-2516/blob/main/index.html
            -> Compilers will convert Source Code Into An Intermediate Language called as 
            Byte Code 
        -> Interpreters: 
            -> Build Process Converts Byte Code To Machine Readable Code 
            -> We use Interpreters to Translate and Execute Machine Readable Code
            -> https://programming604494160.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/execution_of_java_program-e1593172039858.jpg
            -> javac is compiler (java compiler)
            -> java is interpreter (jvm)
        -> Debuggers: 
            -> Softwares to Debug Programs, Step by Step to identify the Behavior of Program 
            -> Debuggers helps in identifying Root Cause Problems 
        -> IDE's: 
            -> Used to Write Code, they have code editors, version control(code tracking),
            auto code completion etc 
        -> etc

    -> Application Softwares 

        -> Application Software is a type of Software that Enables End Users to 
        perform particular tasks like Writing Documents, Browsing Internet etc
